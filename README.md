PRINTF PROJECT The printf project is a collaboration between James Musinde and Bernard Obuya under the ALX School Software Engineering Programme.

This function named "_printf()" imitates the actual "printf()" command located in the stdio.h library of C programming Language. It contains some of the basic features and functions found in the manual 3 of "printf".

_printf() is a function that performs formatted output conversion and print data.
